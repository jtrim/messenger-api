# Messenger API

---

This is a very simple messenger API that allows for logging messages between two users of the system, as well as listing
messages for consumption. The use case for this application would be to provide message endpoints for a messenger client
application, similar to Facebook Messenger or Google Chat.

Datetimes should be sent in ISO 8601 format.
