# Messenger API

[![jtrim](https://circleci.com/gh/jtrim/messenger-api.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/jtrim/messenger-api)

This application is a simple messenger API that allows logging messages between two users of the system.

[You can find this application deployed to Heroku](https://jtrim-messenger-api.herokuapp.com/api/docs) if you would prefer to interact with a web-accessible version of the application.

# Setup

These setup instructions assume that you have Ruby installed, and that it does not require `sudo` to install
dependencies. If you need to install Ruby, my personal favorite ruby management utilities are
https://github.com/postmodern/chruby and https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install.

This application assumes Ruby version 2.5.3. You'll also need to have a PostgreSQL database server running. The database
configuration assumes a postgres user with the same name as your system username (`$ whoami`) and no password, but you can tweak
config/database.yml if you need different settings.

The following command should install all dependencies, create your development and test databases and seed the dev
database.

```shell
$ bin/setup
```

You should see some output that looks something like:

```text
== Installing dependencies ==
The Gemfile's dependencies are satisfied

== Preparing database ==
Created database 'messenger_api_development'
Created database 'messenger_api_test'

Now, to start an application server on port 3000:

    $ bundle exec rails s

Here's an example cURL command to get you started:

    $ curl --header 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:3000/api/v1/messages

API Documentation can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/docs
If you would like to run the tests again:

    $ bundle exec rspec spec --format=doc

If you need to regenerate the api documentation for any reason:

    $ bundle exec rake docs:generate

Enjoy! ‚ùÄ
